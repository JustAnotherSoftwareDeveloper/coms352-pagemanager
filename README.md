This is my Computer Science 352: Operating Systems project at Iowa State University. The description of the project is in a pdf document located in the folder titled "description". I chose to use java for this project due to some issues I had with the g++ versions and unintended behvior on the threads. Given the uniformity of the jvm, this is not really an issue in java.
